# Podium UAA

Podium UAA is  a user accounting and authorizing service for securing  microservices using the OAuth2 
authorization protocol. Podium UAA is an fully configured OAuth2 authorization server with the users and roles 
endpoints inside, wrapped into a usual JHipster application. This allows the developer to deeply configure every aspect 
of his user domain, without restricting on policies by other ready-to-use UAAs.


Podium UAA is developed based on [JHipster UAA](http://www.jhipster.tech/using-uaa/)
