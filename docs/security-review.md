# Security requirements and testing plan for Podium

This page serves to document security
requirements and provides a security review checklist for web applications built with
Spring Boot (including Spring Security) and Angular.


## Application

<dl>
<dt>Application name</dt>
<dd>Podium request portal</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
Request portal for biobanks. 
Each biobank is represented in the portal as a separate organisation.
The application consists of multiple microservices:
one for user and organisation management and authentication, and for creating, reviewing and approving
requests. 
There are different roles for administrators, organisation administrators and coordinators,
reviewers and researchers (that initiate requests).
  
The application has been built on Spring Boot and Spring Cloud and has
an Angular 4 frontend. Parts of the application have been generated by the JHipster
application generator.

## Security requirements

### Introduction

Spring Boot and Angular offer out-of-the-box protection against SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting attacks, and more.
Spring Boot supports role-based permissions, such that, e.g., only administrators can add and edit user accounts.
On top of that, we have to implement data-driven access control: users should only be able to access and modify the requests that they own (have created)
or are assigned to.
We use an SSL certificate for securing the communication between user and server.

Possible vulnerabilities/attack scenario&rsquo;s, if the application is not properly secured, include:
- Someone gains access to the server and finds/accesses the database;
- Someone finds a vulnerability in Spring Boot/other libraries/our application and exploits it to get access to the data;
- Someone sets up a man-in-the-middle attack and can act to the system as the user whose connection is compromised;
- Someone acquires authentication credentials of a user (possibly the administrator) and can login and act as the user.

These and other vulnerabilities/attacks are within the scope of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) standard.
Compliance with the standard should address all of these issues.

Still, a user may have exposed user credentials to an attacker (e.g., using the same password on a compromised system).
Mitigation of such attacks (e.g., using cryptocards for authentication) is out of scope for this system.
Included is, however, logging of user activity (enabling analysis of the damage when an intruder has been detected).

We aim at compliance with level 2 of the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), 2016 version][owasp2016:asvs].
Level 2 of the standard contains security verification requirements on several categories:
authentication, session management, access control, malicious input handling, cryptography, error handling and logging,
data protection, communications, HTTP, malicious controls, business logic, files and resources,
web services, and configuration.

In the next section we summarise these requirements. In the section on [Measures](#chapter-measures),
we describe the measures taken to meet those requirements and list the known weaknesses of the system.



### Security guidelines and checklist

We aim at compliance with level 2 from the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)][owasp2016:asvs]. We give a summary of the requirements below.
OWASP also provides a [security testing guide][owasp2013:testing] and
a [Top 10][owasp2013:top10] of security risks.

#### Application specific requirements

There are no application specific security requirements. 

#### Summary of security requirements from ASVS, level 2

This list of requirements is presented as a checklist. The check box should be ticked if the requirement
is known to be covered by Spring, Angular or the application.
Labels or an explanation should added to each requirement to indicate how the requirement is satisfied.
The labels `Application`, `Spring`, `Angular`, `Apache`, `Annotations`, `Validator`, `JPA`, `TLS` `Puppet`, `BPM` refer to
components described in
the [implementation](#section-implementation) section.
If not ticked, an explanation should be added in the [open issues](#section-issues) section.

## <a id="chapter-measures"></a> Security measures

Most requirements are met by the built-in security of the Spring and Angular
frameworks and by our server configuration.
In the [implementation](#section-implementation) section we list the security measures that have been
taken and cover most of the requirements.
In the [open issues](#section-issues) section we list the open issues that need to be evaluated.
In the section on [testing](#section-testing) we list the tests that are being performed on
code and deployment.
The section on [known weaknesses](#section-knownproblems) lists the known vulnerabilities.


### <a id="section-implementation"></a> Implementation and frameworks

The measures that have been taken to secure the application:

- Spring security for authentication and authorization;
- Spring and Angular prevent Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);
- Access to functionality is protected using Spring routing rules;
- Access to data in controller logic and using security annotations.
- Using JPA derived queries in the repository classes
(SQL queries are derived from interface method names), preventing SQL injection;
- Input sanitisation by Spring (and Angular);
- Custom password strength validator.



For securing the infrastructure:

- Application is run in user space;
- Apache proxy in between, application not directly approachable;
- Only ports 22, 80, and 443 open from the outside (firewall rules);
- On port 80, Apache should only forward to https (rewrite rule,
status 301 (Moved permanently));
- (Optional) `mod_security` has been added to Apache;
- Access log by Apache, logging all incoming requests (URIs, not data),
`mod_security` and by the application.


### <a id="section-microservices"></a> Microservices security model

### <a id="section-issues"></a> Open issues

There is a list of requirements for which it is not clear if they are met and
they are not included in the checks in the next section.

Trying multiple passwords will result in blocking; trying multiple accounts not, but there won&rsquo;t be many accounts, so this is OK.

> No buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

This requirement is difficult to test. We mitigate this risk primarily by checking
the security bulletins of 3rd party libraries and checking libraries for maturity and
active community. See the section on [choosing libraries](#section-libraries).
</dd>


<dt><a id="V5.16-V5.17"></a>V5.16 &ndash; V5.17</dt>
<dd>

> Protect sensitive fields (e.g., role, passwords) from automatic binding.
  Protection against parameter pollution attacks.

We follow the Spring Boot best practices for specifying controllers and binding to
input parameters. All controller logic has a specific HTTP action associated with it,
the parameters are all listed and typed.
We use representation object (simple Java classes) instead of domain classes (entities
that represent the objects in the database) in controller actions.
Sensitive fields are excluded from these representation classes, except for the actions
that are specific for updating sensitive data. E.g., a password field is only included
in the registration and password update representation class and not in the account
update representation class.
</dd>


<dt><a id="V7.12"></a>V7.12</dt>
<dd>

> Personally Identifiable Information should be encrypted at rest.

Encryption at rest is not applied. This would prevent attacks on data through physical
access to the hardware that stores the data. That same hardware has the sensitive data
in memory.

We rely on a trusted hosting provider instead, which is out of scope of the application security requirements.

There is a guideline for [choosing libraries](#section-libraries) that are created by
an active community.
High value transactions have been written as business process models (BPM) and are
executed by a BPM engine, which strictly enforces the business logic.
Using Spring annotations, we implemented many input validation rules.
Access control and authentication are implemented using Spring Security and
custom access control annotations and aspects that have been extensively tested.

### <a id="section-testing"></a> Security testing

#### Code checks

The analysis that has been done on code/application level:
- Security code review:
  - Proper routes, method annotation on all REST controllers?
  - How are user roles assigned? Who can change them? Should only be administrators.
  - No custom queries or all nicely prepared using prepared statements
(JPA provides this);
  - Check that user input is not used for:
determining filesystem paths, checking for access, determining user id or roles,
database key in a query. (A common error: checking access based on the _id_ in the url
(`@PathVariable`), but fetching the database object based on the _id_ in the request body.)
- Test injection:
  - Test for XSS attacks: try to insert HTML and Javascript in input fields;
this should be handled automagically by Spring.
- Regularly check <https://pivotal.io/security> for vulnerabilities in Spring.



#### Deployment checks

Disable dev/test behaviour on the production environment.
Checking this list is part of deployment to production.

- Default users disabled (e.g., `palga` &mdash; check startup log of application and user administration);
- No action `/test/clear/` available;
- Check account blocking period after _n_ failed login attempts.
- Check for SSL certificate, make sure key chain is secure and valid. Check with: <https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/>.
- Check that requests on port 80 are forwarded to `https`.
- Check that the database is not accessible (except from localhost) and passwords are properly set.
- Check that database password in the application configuration is not exposed (e.g., in `puppet`).
- Use scripts that checks if the current deployment uses the
newest versions of included frameworks:
    ```bash
    mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
    mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
    mvn dependency-check:check
    npm outdated
    bower list
    ```
