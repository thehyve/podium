                This will send a request to reindex all data from your primary datasource into Elasticsearch. This will
                fix
                missing data and mapping issues, however you will lose any ES data and mapping that was defined outside
                of your
                application. This request will return immediately and the reindexing will run in the background. You
                will see
                "Elasticsearch: Successfully performed reindexing" in your logs when this is complete.
